    "The results from the algorithms are run above in their corresponding cells and shown underneath. Given that the dataset is generated randomly each time the notebook is run, speaking to the specifics of the results is difficult. Instead, there was a trend that was noticed when analyzing the results over the course of a number of runs. More specifically that the KMeans algorithm for clustering tended to keep the number of individuals per group around the original number specified by the original groupings. The number of people per group typically ranged from 11-21 people giving a smaller spread, (+5/-5), than its MeanShift counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MeanShift algorithm, due to the need for the use of a dynamic quantile to get to 4 clusters specifically, it was run in a while loop with a break condition on it. Given that this was the case, a step of 0.005 was used to increment the quantile every time with the hopes of achieving a successful clustering into specifically 4 groups. Over numerous runs, however, achieving a specific clustering of 4 groups proved not always possible with MeanShift and instead often opted for less. Further, when the data was clustered into 4 groups it often saw one group taking the majority share of people while the others were left with very few.\n",
